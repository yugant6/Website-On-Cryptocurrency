<img src="cce.jpg" height="500px" width="1070px">
<br></br><h3>What to look out for before joining an exchange?</h3><hr>
<p style="font-size:17px;">There are some risks with trading. Here are a few things you should check before making your first trade</br></br>
<b>•	Reputation – </b>The best way to find out about an exchange is to search through reviews from individual users and well-known industry websites. You can ask any questions you might have on forums like BitcoinTalk or Reddit.</br>
<b>•	Fees –</b> Most exchanges should have fee-related information on their websites. Before joining, make sure you understand deposit, transaction and withdrawal fees. Fees can differ substantially depending on the exchange you use.</br>
<b>•	Payment Methods – </b>What payment methods are available on the exchange? Credit & debit card? wire transfer? PayPal? If an exchange has limited payment options then it may not be convenient for you to use it. Remember that purchasing cryptocurrencies with a credit card will always require identity verification and come with a premium price as there is a higher risk of fraud and higher transaction and processing fees. Purchasing cryptocurrency via wire transfer will take significantly longer as it takes time for banks to process.</br>
<b>•	Verification Requirements –</b> The vast majority of the Bitcoin trading platforms in india require some sort of ID verification in order to make deposits & withdrawals. Some exchanges will allow you to remain anonymous. Although verification, which can take up to a few days, might seem like a pain, it protects the exchange against all kinds of scams and money laundering.</br>
<b>•	Geographical Restrictions –</b> Some specific user functions offered by exchanges are only accessible from certain countries. Make sure the exchange you want to join allows full access to all platform tools and functions in the country you currently live in.</br>
<b>•	Exchange Rate –</b> Different exchanges have different rates. You will be surprised how much you can save if you shop around. It’s not uncommon for rates to fluctuate up to 10% and even higher in some instances.</p>

<p style="font-size:17px;">Despite the proof of identity requirements, remember exchanges and wallets don't provide the same protections banks do. Bitcoin does not have legal status as a currency in most of the world, and authorities usually do not know how best to approach thefts. Some larger exchanges have replaced customer funds after a theft from the exchange itself, but at this stage they are not legally obliged to do so.</br>
Further, if a theft from your personal wallet occurs due to a security or password lapse on your part, you do not have any guaranteed way to recover your funds</p>
